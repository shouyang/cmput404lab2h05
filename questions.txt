Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
    The SOCK_STREAM denotes a TCP type socket.

    In essence:
    s = socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)

Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python? 
    Client sockets can simply connect directly.

    Server sockets are management sockets, they need to bind/listen/accept into client servicing sockets.

Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
    Set the socket option for reuse.

    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
    We get a address object containing the following on the connection:
        family, socktype, proto, cannonname, sockaddr


Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
    None
